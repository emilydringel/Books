# Books

This project (written in Java) leverages the Google Books API and the Genderize API to review the gender breakdown of names and gendered words mentioned in the description of a given book. The tool will take in an Author and/or a Title (or segments of either) and will respond with the number of traditional male names and words, the number of traditional female names and words, and will use these numbers to give a percentage of gendered words that are traditionally female for all matching books.

## Getting Started

Once you fork this project, you should not need to do any other preparation. Both APIs do not need keys to run, however might hit a limit depending on use.
